# This is NOT READY YET

@kataras preparing this package, maybe the final package's name change. All code you see here is just my tries/thoughs to make the websockets easier for Iris' users.
Do not judge the code you see now, it will change and be cleaned on the final v3 version.

(Folder contains unique , Iris', code) If you have bigger experience on 'realtime' applications than me(8+ years) OR you have ideas which can help me to this particular solution,[post and issue here](https://github.com/kataras/iris/issues) in order to discuss, together, how we could (re)design this package.

## Why public then?

I public this code because I want Iris' users  to see the process, maybe you can learn things that you didn't know before, but most important you will be updated for the next v3 Iris' websocket support.
